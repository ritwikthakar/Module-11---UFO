# Module-11 UFO
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project is to build an HTML page that will allow us to extract information from a java script data file using filters on the page. Since there are many different sightings that have occurred throughout the US, it will be easier to apply filters to get desired results. We can filter based on date of sighting, city, state, country & shape.

## Results
Once the website is open, our viewers will notice the basic opening and title with the picture at the top. As they scroll down, they will come across all the data and filters that we have in place for shot listing. Data on this website can be filtered by date, city, state, country & shape. Viewers can select any of these filters enter the search bar, then the HTML page will show all the sightings for that specific search. Multiple filters can be used at the same time to further inspect the data in the specific search bar that is entered.

## Summary
We have created a webpage which allows the user to filter data through different parameters. One limitation of our search bar is trying to validate the sightings that happened which can be better described in the data. If we have data about how many people saw the phenomenon would be a helpful element to validating the claims. Having as much data as possible for website would make it as good as it can possible be. 

## Recommendations
The following would be my recommendations for improving this website.
-	To have more data that has more information including how many people were at the site to validate the claims.
-	Adding another filter to search the sightings by length and finally have a site that would be constantly update our data adding new sightings to our page.
